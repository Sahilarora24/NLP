Let‚Äôs see how modern AI tools LLMs, Workflows, and AI Agents ‚Äî can help simplify this task.1. Large Language Models (LLMs)LLMs are AI models trained on huge amounts of text data. They understand and generate human-like language.Think of it as a smart friend who‚Äôs great at giving suggestions, summarising information, and writing content.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeWhat it can do:Generate ideas for your Diwali partySuggest venues, food, and decorWrite invitation messagesSummarize venue details you provideExample in Action: You ask the LLM to help plan a Diwali party. It suggests banquet halls, menus, and decor ideas. You then share a banquet hall webpage, and it summarizes the key info (cost, capacity, location). However, all actions research, booking, coordination are still on you.Verdict: LLMs are great advisors, but they don‚Äôt take action.2. WorkflowsA workflow is a sequence of steps or tasks to achieve a specific goal often automated.Think of it as a to-do list that gets executed by software in a certain order.What it can do:Collect data (e.g., venue options from a website).Filter and format information.Send updates via email or WhatsApp.Pair with LLMs for summaries.Example in Action: You set up a workflow that checks a banquet hall website every Sunday, filters for 30-person halls, summarizes results via an LLM, and sends you the summary.It saves time, but you still decide and act on the results.Verdict: Workflows are fast and automated but not flexible or intelligent.Press enter or click to view image in full size3. AI AgentsAI Agents combine LLMs with tools, memory, and decision-making skills. They think, act, and adapt and execute tasks like a personal event planner.What they do:Search and compare venues based on your budget and preferences.Decide on the best option.Book the venueSend invites and schedule remindersRemember your preferences for next time.Example:An AI Agent, ‚ÄúDiwaliStar,‚Äù finds venues, picks one within your budget, books it, sends invites, and adds the party to your calendar. It even reminds guests to RSVP.Verdict: AI Agents are like smart assistants who not only plan but act on your behalf.Press enter or click to view image in full sizePress enter or click to view image in full sizeEach approach has its place:LLMs are ideal for brainstorming and writing.Workflows are best for repeating routine tasks.AI Agents bring it all together thinking, acting, and adapting.In future digital assistants, AI Agents will be your go-to for handling real-world, complex tasks like planning your next family Diwali bash.Up Next on the Blog!In Part 2 @I‚Äôll walk you through agent types Single and Multi AI Agents and show how they can take your Diwali party planning to the next level with smarter automation.In Part 1, we explored how LLMs, Workflows, and AI Agents can simplify planning a Diwali party.Single AI Agent vs. Multi AI Agent: What‚Äôs the Difference?medium.comThanks for reading!
